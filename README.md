#Learning Android

1.So in the first folder (Coroutines) I pushed the projects where I learned about coroutines

2.In the Main App folder (Learn_Binding) I have my main app where I implemented most of what I've learn
(constrains, viewBinding, dataBinding, FirebaseAuth, FirebaseDatabase, lifeCycle, viewModels, fragments, navigation, etc...)

3.In the Test Apps folder it's only garbage
