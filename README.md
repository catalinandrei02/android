#Learning Android

UPDATE: I moved on to another app (Project Motivation) this will be beautiluf and better than the last app
        (No more legacy dependencies, better code, everything up to date, animations, onboarding screen, 
         gradient animated backgrounds,RxKotlin3,RxBinding4, ViewPager2 with dotIndicator, and more to come)

1.So in the first folder (Coroutines) I pushed the projects where I learned about coroutines

2.In the Main App folder (Learn_Binding) I have my main app where I implemented most of what I've learn
(constrains, viewBinding, dataBinding, FirebaseAuth, FirebaseDatabase, lifeCycle, viewModels, fragments, navigation, etc...)

3.In the Test Apps folder it's only garbage
